One of the major objectives of SEDRIS is to provide a mechanism for
unambiguous environmental data interchanges.  To accomplish this
objective, SEDRIS developed a data representation model (DRM)
encompassing all the data requirements of synthetic environments
used in every type of simulation application.  The data contained
in the SEDRIS DRM covers every environmental domain  -
terrain, ocean, atmosphere and space.  Prior to SEDRIS, projects
attempting to provide an environmental data interchange mechanism
focused on development of a format for the interchange medium.
Unfortunately, a format-focused approach led to ambiguous data,
since the underlying meaning and relationships of the data could not
be captured with just a description of the data's format.  The
SEDRIS DRM provides not only a clear description of the data, but also
defines the relationships between the data that are critical to
ensuring correct interpretation by users.

What Is a Data Representation Model?

<td class="doc_set_toc_outline_description"><p>
A <I>data representation model (DRM)</I> is a description used to provide
identification of all data elements within a system, including their
attributes and the logical relationships between data elements.  In
object-oriented terminology, this is viewed as a class hierarchy, and
described through a graphics-based design tool
(<I>see</I> <a href="#23">Section 2.3</a>).  Each major type of data
with important or explicit relationships is captured to show its
logical relationship to other types of data.  A DRM is <B><I>not</I></B> an
implementation of a database, but a depiction of the types of data
within the system. The SEDRIS DRM is described by an associated
data dictionary (<I>see</I> <a href="#25">Section 2.5</a>) that
provides information about each type of data, its attributes,
and its logical relationships. SEDRIS also employs a set of
&quot;constraints&quot; (<I>see</I> <a href="#26">Section 2.6</a> and
<a href="constraints/index.htm">Appendix B</a>) that place restrictions on
the practical use of specific elements of the DRM.
</p><p>
The DRM consists of a set of classes, together with supporting
primitive data structures.  The classes express the organizational structure of
the data being described - that is, its data representation - while the
primitive data structures (also called <I>data types</I>) define the
fundamental data elements that are used to specify the classes.  The
DRM also specifies the formal relationships between classes.  All this
information (i.e., classes, fields, and relationships) can be thought of
as a specialized language with its own grammar.  This specialized language
serves to minimize differences of interpretation in the DRM.

Unified Modeling Language (UML) Notation

<td class="doc_set_toc_outline_description"><p>
The SEDRIS DRM uses a specific notation to provide a shorthand method to
depict the information necessary to describe the data elements, their
attributes, and the logical relationships between data elements.  This
notation allows graphical presentation of the DRM in a clear manner,
while also providing a means to capture fully the design of
the data.  The DRM is a representational scheme, not a format,
although a DRM can be easily mapped to a format, and in fact has one -
the SEDRIS Transmittal Format (STF).
</p><p>
The SEDRIS DRM is described using an extended form of
Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation.  For the most part, the notation
is UML.  The UML notation follows the object-oriented methodology for
organizing data. The main extensions to UML used by SEDRIS are that
1) abstract classes are shaded, 2) fields of classes are not normally
shown on SEDRIS class diagrams.
</p><p>
The SEDRIS DRM diagrams are provided in <a href="p4v2-g.htm">Appendix G</a>.
The current versions of both the DRM diagrams and the DRM notation are
available for on-line viewing or may be downloaded for local use from the
SEDRIS web site (<a href="http://www.sedris.org">www.sedris.org</a>).

Data Representation Modeling Technique
</th>
</tr>

<tr><th class="doc_set_toc_outline_number"></th>
<td class="doc_set_toc_outline_description"><p>
Classes in an object-oriented data model (rather than a DRM) are an
abstraction of real-world &quot;things&quot; found in the problem domain, and
are described using real-world terminology.  Using this modeling concept, one
might expect to see such classes as <I>Tree</I>, <I>Tank</I>, and
<I>Building</I> in the SEDRIS DRM, if it were a data model rather than
a data representation model.  However, that is not the case; the problem
domain of SEDRIS is the <I>representation</I> of the real-world environment.
This representation is accomplished through the use of DRM constructs
with the ability to specify the data necessary to produce both visual and
non-visual representations of environments.  Consequently, one set
of classes in the SEDRIS DRM is the family of &quot;Geometry&quot;
classes, such as
<a href="classes/Point.htm">&lt;Point&gt;</a>,
<a href="classes/Line.htm">&lt;Line&gt;</a>, and
<a href="classes/Polygon.htm">&lt;Polygon&gt;</a>,
which provide information that can be used to render a
visual scene.
</p><p>
Consider, for example, a road. One data provider, concerned with
renderable geometry, might represent a road as a collection of
texture-mapped polygons, and would therefore represent the road as
a collection of <a href="classes/Polygon.htm">&lt;Polygon&gt;</a>
instances in SEDRIS, where the entire collection is tagged with a
<a href="classes/ClassificationData.htm">&lt;Classification Data&gt;</a>
identifying it as a road. However, the data thus provided by the
road's visual representation, while suited to rendering the
road in a visual scene, is not suited for data providers whose
applications are required to recognize a road and make decisions
based on its presence in the environment. For example, where
does the road begin and end? What other roads, if any, cross it
and where are the crossings?
</p><p>
<I>Topology</I> information provides connectivity and adjacency information
in an environment, and is represented explicitly in SEDRIS by topology
classes. To represent a road as a &quot;thing&quot; with associated
topological information, a data provider can represent it as a
<a href="classes/FeatureRepresentation.htm">&lt;Feature Representation&gt;</a>,
which by definition has associated topological information. A data provider
might choose to represent the road in this example as a
<a href="classes/LinearFeature.htm">&lt;Linear Feature&gt;</a>,
where each segment of the road is a separate
<a href="classes/FeatureTopology.htm">&lt;Feature Topology&gt;</a>
instance, in this case,
a <a href="classes/FeatureEdge.htm">&lt;Feature Edge&gt;</a> instance.
Again, the &lt;Linear Feature&gt; would
be identified as a road by the presence of appropriate
<a href="classes/ClassificationData.htm">&lt;Classification Data&gt;</a>.
The topology relationships assist the reasoning models by providing explicit
information, instead of performing calculations to derive the information.
</p><p>
If a data provider wished to provide both representations, indicating
that they corresponded to the same &quot;thing&quot;, this would be
done by providing both representations and joining them with an
association relationship to indicate that each is an alternate
representation of the other.

SEDRIS Data Dictionary

<td class="doc_set_toc_outline_description"><p>
The SEDRIS DRM is described by an associated data dictionary that defines
each class, its fields, and the formal relationships between classes. Because
the DRM is so densely populated, the class fields are <B><I>not</I></B>
presented in the DRM diagrams / illustrations.  The class fields are
documented in the data dictionary.  (The omission of the class fields from
the DRM diagrams is a deviation from the UML notation.)
</p><p>
The data dictionary documents all DRM classes.  Each class' entry is
considered a &quot;term&quot; in the dictionary.  Each term
(representing a class of data) is described using a standard notation
(see below).  The data dictionary is
divided into many hypertext files, designed to be used interactively
through an Internet web browser.  There is also a plain text version
available for printing (500+ pages).  Each class within the
data dictionary is linked to the primary DRM diagram on which it
appears, followed by any other pages on which the class is
referenced. The current version of the SEDRIS data dictionary is
available for on-line viewing or may be downloaded for local use from
the SEDRIS web site (<a href="http://www.sedris.org">www.sedris.org</a>).
</p></p>
A standard class entry in the SEDRIS data dictionary
contains one or more of the following items of information, in
the order shown.  Not all items of information are provided
for every class; which are provided depends on the nature of the
individual class.
