 Topology level ZERO.

 The following DRM objects and relationships shall exist:

 DRM objects:
 a. &lt;Feature Node&gt; - one or more instances.

 b. &lt;Feature Edge&gt; - required if any &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances
                     exist

  Relationships:
  a. A two-way association between &lt;Feature Node&gt; instances and
     &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instances:
     1. shall exist for each &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instance that is
        connected to a given &lt;Feature Node&gt; instance; and

     2. shall exist for each of the two &lt;Feature Node&gt; instances
        (starting node and ending node) that bound each
        &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instance.

  Constraints:
      No additional constraints are required.

  Other types of feature topology DRM objects and relationships
  may exist at level SE_FTL_ZERO, but are not required. The
  requirements of level SE_FTL_ONE shall not be met. Thus,
  there shall be at least one pair of collocated &lt;Feature Node&gt;
  instances.

      with unique coordinates. That is, no two &lt;Feature Node&gt;

 Topology level THREE.

  The following DRM objects and relationships are required to exist,
  in addition to the requirements of topology level TWO.

  DRM objects:
  a.  &lt;Feature Face&gt; - one or more instances, and

  b.  &lt;Feature Face Ring&gt; - one or more instances for each
      &lt;Feature Face&gt; instance

  a.  A two-way association between &lt;Feature Node&gt; instances and
      &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances shall exist for each &lt;Feature Node&gt;
      instance located in the interior of a &lt;Feature Face&gt; instance.

  b.  A one-way association from &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instances to
      &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances shall exist for each of the
      &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances that each &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instance

  c.  A one-way association from &lt;Feature Face Ring&gt; instances to
      &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instances shall exist for each of the
      &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instances that bound a &lt;Feature Face&gt; instance.

  Constraints:
  a.  &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances may not intersect or overlap one
      another, except where they meet at a common &lt;Feature Edge&gt;
      instance.

  b.  The set of &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances shall be exclusive and
      exhaustive, forming a complete topological surface.

  c.  Each &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instance shall bound exactly two
      &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances.

  d.  Exactly one &lt;Feature Face&gt; instance within the parent
      &lt;Union Of Feature Topology&gt; instance shall have its
      universal field set to SE_TRUE.  All other &lt;Feature Face&gt;

  No additional types of DRM objects or relationships are required.

  Constraints:
  a.  &lt;Location 3D&gt; instances are required for all coordinates.

  b.  Each &lt;Feature Edge&gt; instance may bound zero or more
      &lt;Feature Face&gt; instances. (This overrides the level THREE
      constraint.)

  DRM objects:
  a.  &lt;Feature Volume&gt; - one or more instances, and

  b.  &lt;Feature Volume Shell&gt; - one or more instances for each
