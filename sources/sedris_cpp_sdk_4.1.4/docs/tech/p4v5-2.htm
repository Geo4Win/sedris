The concept of <a href="drm/classes/ControlLink.htm">&lt;Control Link&gt;</a>s
can be applied to a wide range of problems related to representing control
over the values of fields and states of SEDRIS objects, as well as
representing the behaviour of such control. This overview will begin by
discussing <a href="drm/classes/ControlLink.htm">&lt;Control Link&gt;</a>s in
the context of the three original issues that they were originally designed to
address. Readers are encouraged to evaluate
<a href="drm/classes/ControlLink.htm">&lt;Control Link&gt;</a>s and consider
how they might be used or extended to solve their own problems.
</p><p>
The three original issues were:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Transmittals need a mechanism to allow a consuming system to
dynamically control objects within a transmittal. The need for this
control extends beyond extracting individual
<a href="drm/classes/Model.htm">&lt;Model&gt;</a> instances for use as
&quot;moving models&quot;, or objects that are moved through or
within the parent transmittal; it includes the need to identify and
control the state of objects that are part of the environment that
have dynamic behaviour. Examples of these objects include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> moving objects, e.g. wind socks, rotating beacons
</li>
<li> objects that change appearance dynamically, e.g. with changing radiance
</li>
<li> destructible objects, e.g. bridges, buildings
</li>
<li> the thermal energy of an automobile as it starts up
</li>
<li> tank gun and turret
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>
Transmittals shall be able to represent how the behaviour or state of
one object affects other objects in the transmittal. Examples of such
objects include
</p>
<ul>
<li> the relationship of the rotation of various gears in a gear system
<li> the relationship of the tail rotor rotation to the main
     rotor rotation on a helicopter
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>
Transmittals shall be able to represent instances of
<a href="drm/classes/Model.htm">&lt;Model&gt;</a> instances
 in which some of the
     attributes of the <a href="drm/classes/Model.htm">&lt;Model&gt;</a>
     change from instance to instance. This type of
     <a href="drm/classes/Model.htm">&lt;Model&gt;</a> is sometimes referred to
     as a &quot;smart instance&quot; or &quot;basis set&quot;.
     Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> object clusters, e.g. trees, in which the elevation of each
     object shall reflect the elevation of the terrain surface below
     the object
</li>
<li> generic objects, e.g. houses, that may have different colours in
     different instances
</li>
<li> objects (e.g. buildings, bridges) in which the vertices
     representing polygons that &quot;touch&quot; the terrain
     are required to conform to the terrain without distorting
     the remaining vertices, so that the object is &quot;level&quot;
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
