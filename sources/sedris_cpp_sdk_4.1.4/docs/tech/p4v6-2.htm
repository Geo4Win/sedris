A large body of environmental data exists in the form of
<I>Property Grids</I>. We use the term 'Property Grid' here to mean
homogeneous attributed data (properties) associated with a
spatial location grid.  An example is a DTED data set giving
terrain elevation in a regular latitude / longitude (Geodetic) grid.
Examples from the meteorological and oceanographic community (METOC)
include Bathymetry (ocean bottom depths) in regular latitude /
longitude (Geodetic) grids, and air temperature, humidity and other
characteristics at a given altitude in a latitude/longitude grid.
</p><p>
This information could be represented in the SEDRIS Data Representation Model
as an aggregate of <a href="drm/classes/Point.htm">&lt;Points&gt;</a>
each with a set of
<a href="drm/classes/PropertyValue.htm">&lt;Property Value&gt;</a>
components providing the attributed data for
the given location.  However, considerable storage economy can be
gained by exploiting the regular grid structure of the grid locations.
For example, if a grid consists of two-dimensional rectangular cells,
then the locations of all these cells can be specified by:
</p>
<ol>
<li>the location of the center of one reference cell;
</li>
<li>the row and column directions (orientations);
</li>
<li>the row and column indices of the reference cell;
</li>
<li>the number of rows and columns;
</li>
<li>the length and width of the cells.
</li>
</ol>
A large number of locations can thus be specified very concisely.  Once
the locations are specified, cell data without location information can
be stored in one sequential block. (Locations are associated with their
corresponding sequential positions in the block by row / column
indexing.)

<td class="doc_set_toc_outline_description"><p>
There are several tacit assumptions in the simple grid model described
in the previous section, with important implications for the
SEDRIS Data Representation Model.
</p><p>
The most fundamental of these assumptions is the notion of specifying
a location. In a simulation and modeling context, locations are
specified as coordinates relative to a chosen spatial reference frame (SRF).
The spatial reference frame is a given in many simulation systems;
however, the inter-operability objectives of SEDRIS require SEDRIS to
support several spatial reference frames. A SEDRIS transmittal
explicitly specifies the spatial reference frame within in which
locations are defined as part of the transmittal.
One objective of the API is to make the transmittal appear independent
of the SRF choice (an SRF-free representation).
A SEDRIS user can select his preferred SRF, and the
SEDRIS API will provide transmittal data relative to the user's
SRF.  This SRF transparency is
possible for individual locations because there are invertible
coordinate transformations between any pair of allowed SEDRIS
SRFs (for further details, see <b>Part 4, Volume 11:
Spatial Reference Model</b>).
This SRF transparency breaks down for gridded locations because,
in general, the coordinate transformations do not preserve coordinate length.
For example, a grid of locations specified by Geodetic latitude and longitude
will not be a grid when the locations are mapped onto a coordinate system
which preserves distance, and vice versa. (e.g.: One degree of longitude
does not have a fixed length in metres).  This is an important issue for
most METOC databases, which are gridded in latitude/longitude coordinates.
In other words, the &quot;griddedness&quot; of a set of locations
is not generally preserved after a spatial reference frame transformation.
Since &quot;griddedness&quot;
is coordinate system dependent, the information in the simple model (1)-(5)
above must be supplemented by the identification of the underlying
coordinate system:
</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>grid spatial reference frame specification.</li>
</ol>
This explicit specification of the spatial reference frame exposes the
ambiguity of (1) and (2), which, with (5), must be clarified by changing:
<ol>
<li>the location of the center of one reference cell;</li>
<li>the row and column directions (orientations);</li>
</ol>
and
<ol start="5">
<li>the length and width of the cells.</li>
</ol>

to:
<br />
(1') the location in world coordinates of the center of one reference cell;
<br />
(2') the row and column directions (orientations) relative to world coordinates; and
<br />
(5') the length and width of the cells in grid spatial reference frame units.

Data Types and Special Values

<td class="doc_set_toc_outline_description">
Another tacit assumption of the simple grid model (1)-(5) is that
row and column indices are sufficient to access associated data from
a data block.  In fact, proper retrieval and interpretation requires
the stored memory size of the data and a specification of the units
of measurement.  If each grid location has several associated data
items (e.g.: both temperature and humidity) then the order as well
as the item identification are required.  This information for each
item, identity, storage size, and units provided in an ordered list
will be referred to as the property grid signature.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>signature</li>
</ol>
The information in modified items (1')-(7) specifies the grid locations
and the method of extracting data; only (7) deals with the
interpretation of the data.  Implicit in that interpretation is the
assumption that each cell contains usable data.  In fact, large area
grids are likely to contain cells that are invalid for some reason.
This is typical of METOC databases in which ocean data is gridded in
large grids that cover landmasses and areas of insufficient data.
The Oceanographic and Atmospheric Master Library (OAML),
for example, deals with this problem by flagging cell-specific
special conditions with special value data records.  In the case of
most OAML databases, special data record values are specified only
in supporting documentation.  Users of gridded data are less likely
to use invalid data if these special values are explicitly
identified in a standard way.  Indeed, if special values are
represented in a standard way, then extraction methods using the
API could enforce the exclusion of data from invalid cells.  OAML
uses two types of special value record to flag invalid cells: one
flags an &quot;over land&quot; cell and the other flags
&quot;no data.&quot; It is conceivable that other gridded databases
might have more than two useful flag conditions, and they may apply
separately to each item in the signature.  The SEDRIS
Data Representation Model should therefore provide additional signature
characteristic values (with interpretation) on an item by item basis.
We therefore add to the list:
<ol start="8">
<li>signature item special characteristics.</li>
</ol>

Modified items (1')-(8) provide information that is useful or necessary
for the representation of a two dimensional uniform grid of data in a
SEDRIS Data Representation Model.  This model can be generalized in
several ways.  The grid is called uniform because, as indicated in (5'),
each cell is the same size.  One generalization is to allow geometric
uniformity; that is uniform on a logarithmic scale.
</p><p>
Another generalization is to define a non-uniform grid as one for which
the row or column cell-length depends on the row or column index.  In
other words, an R row by C column grid of locations can be specified
by C positions on the row direction axis and R positions on the column
directions axis.  While this requires more storage information than
(5'), we still have the efficiency of axis locations specifying grid
locations.
</p><p>
Another generalization of a property grid is to dimensions other than
two.  For example, air temperature, humidity, etc. can be specified
in a three-dimensional volume grid, with elevation as the third
dimension.  Similarly, measurement in one dimension such as
atmospheric soundings measured in altitude only at a specific
latitude / longitude.
</p><p>
These generalities can be achieved by defining an
<a href="drm/classes/Axis.htm">&lt;Axis&gt;</a>
class in the SEDRIS DRM that contains the characteristics of each
axis including (4) and (5').  Thus we have replaced:
<br />
(4) the number of row and columns;
<br />
(5') the length and width of the cells in grid coordinate system units;
<br />
with
<br />
(9) an ordered list of axes.

Property tables are (multi-dimensional) arrays of property data.
They can be thought of as labeled tabulated data.  If we now drop
the implicit requirement of <b>spatial</b> grids and <b>spatial</b>
axes that are in geographic units, and allow a variety of axis
units (metric axes) and even allow enumeration types (nominal axes),
then the relaxed requirements can encompass property table
data structures.  The row (and columns) of the array are either
indexed by numeric values or labeled by enumeration values.  The
tables are not limited to three dimensions.  In the next section,
we define <a href="drm/classes/RegularAxis.htm">&lt;Regular Axis&gt;</a>,
<a href="drm/classes/IrregularAxis.htm">&lt;Irregular Axis&gt;</a>, and
<a href="drm/classes/EnumerationAxis.htm">&lt;Enumeration Axis&gt;</a>,
and <a href="drm/classes/IntervalAxis.htm">&lt;Interval Axis&gt;</a> to
deal with these axis generalizations.   In dropping spatial requirements, a
property table retains requirements (7) the signature,
(8) signature item special characteristics, and (9) an ordered list of
(generalized) axes.

The grid signature list allows a set of simple values to be associated
with each grid location.  However, some grids are vector or data table
valued.  For example, a 2-D surface grid might have at each grid
location table of radar absorptivity indexed by wavelength and
incidence angle.  If each grid location table uses the same wavelength
and incidence angle values then wavelength and angle can be used as
two additional (non-spatial) axes to achieve additional storage
efficiency.  In this case, we have both spatial and non-spatial axes
indexing property data which is a function of both grid location and
other (non-spatial axis) parameters.
</p><p>
Another table valued case to consider is one in which there are many
grid locations sharing a smaller number of distinct tables.  In this
case, we need only to index the tables and store a table index at
each location.

This section has introduced some criteria and requirements for
property grids and more generally, property tables.  The modified
criteria (1'-3, 6-9) motivate the definition of
<a href="drm/classes/Axis.htm">&lt;Axis&gt;</a> classes
for axes, <a href="drm/classes/TablePropertyDescription.htm">
&lt;Table Property Description&gt;</a> class for cell signatures,
and the <a href="drm/classes/DataTable.htm">&lt;Data Table&gt;</a>
class and its specializations such as
<a href="drm/classes/PropertyGrid.htm">&lt;Property Grid&gt;</a>
and <a href="drm/classes/PropertyTable.htm">&lt;Property Table&gt;</a>.
</p><p>
As can be seen, a data table requires a signature (7,8), and an
ordered list of axes (9).  By adding location and
spatial reference frame information (1-3,5,6) a data table
specializes to a property grid.  Using these concepts, the following
sections will define the DRM classes
used to realize these notions.
