<a name="1" id="1"><strong>CONCEPTS</strong></a>
<p>
Every concept has a definition, two ways to denote that concept (a
label, a code), and ties to concepts in other documents (standards,
specifications, dictionaries, publications).
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong><i>definition</i></strong> field of an EDCS Dictionary Entry
is a precise statement of the nature, properties, scope or essential
qualities of a concept embodied in the entry. Definitions are complete
and concise, and may include the name or names for the concept as part
of the definition.
</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong><i>label</i></strong> field of an EDCS Dictionary Entry is a
compact and human-readable designator that is used to denote a concept.
Labels may include the name or names for the concept. Labels:
<ul>
<li>uniquely denote a concept within a dictionary,</li>
<li>are a succinct expression of the concept it denotes,</li>
<li>are represented as a character string, and</li>
<li>are human readable.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong><i>code</i></strong> field of an EDCS Dictionary Entry is a
compact, and not necessarily human-readable, designator that is used to
denote a concept. Codes:
<ul>
<li>uniquely denote a concept within a dictionary,</li>
<li>are represented as an integer, and</li>
<li>are assigned sequentially in increasing order within an
  EDCS Dictionary, beginning at 1.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li><p>There is a one-to-one relationship between labels and codes in the
 same EDCS Dictionary. Therefore, a label and a code may be used
 interchangeably to denote the same concept.
</p></li>
<li><p>Concepts in two documents (the EDCS and some external document) may
 be related in several different ways. <strong><i>Reference types</i></strong>,
 <strong><i>references</i></strong>, and <strong><i>supplemental references</i></strong> establish
 the relationship between an EDCS concept and an external concept.
</p></li>
</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<a name="2" id="2"><strong>CONCEPT TIES</strong></a>
<p>
To improve unambiguous communication across disparate domains, the
goal is to bring together (consistently) concepts that are seen as
&quot;authoritative&quot; in those domains. Typing references helps
identify the degree to which an EDCS concept is viewed as
&quot;authoritative&quot; in another
community. It also may serve as a starting point for developing mappings
from the specialized languages of communities to the cross-community
language of the EDCS. Two types of reference (normative and informative)
are insufficient to capture all of the possible relationships between the
EDCS and another document. In the following, a <i>specification</i> is a
document that meets the requirements to be normatively referenced by the
EDCS, and the <i>owner</i> of such a specification is the organization
responsible for maintaining the specification.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><i>Prescriptive reference</i></strong> (PR): The concept in the
EDCS is the same concept as defined in an external specification. The
definition of the concept in EDCS may be different from the definition
in the specification because of modifications to:
<ul>
<li>include missing (implied) context not present in the definition
    in the specification; or</li>
<li>to match the style and structure of other definitions in the EDCS.</li>
</ul><br />
In this case, a citation is provided in the <i>references</i> field.
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><i>Authoritative reference</i></strong> (AR): The concept in
the EDCS prescriptively references a concept from an external specification,
and an agreement has been established between the owner of the EDCS and the
owner of that specification to ensure that the concept authoritatively
referenced is not changed without the agreement of the owner of the
EDCS. In this case, a citation is provided in the <i>references</i>
field.
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><i>Informative reference</i></strong> (IR): The concept from
the EDCS is related to, or derived from, concepts in one or more external
documents. In this case, one or more citations are provided in the
<i>references</i> field.
</p></li>
<li><p><strong><i>Non-referenced</i></strong> (NR): No satisfactory prescriptive,
authoritative, dictionary or informative reference is available in
another document for re-use as a concept in the EDCS. The meaning of the
definition of the concept is determined by using the appropriate
dictionary definitions of the words comprising the definition,
considering the context in which each word is used. In this case, no
citation is provided in the <i>references</i> field.
</p></li>
</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<a name="3" id="3"><strong>CONCEPT REUSE</strong></a>
<p>
Concepts may be used within the definition of other concepts. This
creates a web of explicitly inter-related concepts, reduces the complexity
of individual definitions, and ensures that concepts in, and across,
dictionaries &quot;fit together&quot;.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If an EC is used in the definition of another concept, this use is
 represented in the definition by placing the label for that EC in single
 angle brackets (&lt;&nbsp;&gt;) in the definition.
</p></li>
<li><p>If an EA is used in the definition of another concept, this use is
 represented in the definition by placing the label for that EA in double
 angle brackets (&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;) in the definition.
</p></li>
<li><p>If an EE is used in the definition of another EE for the same enumerated EA,
 this use is represented in the definition by placing the label for that
EE in triple angle brackets (&lt;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;) in the definition.
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="4" id="4"><strong>CLASSIFICATIONS and ATTRIBUTES</strong></a>
<p>
Classifications are typings-of-objects (in the
<a href="dictionary/ECC.htm">EC Dictionary</a>);
attributes are states-of-objects (in the
<a href="dictionary/EAC.htm">EA Dictionary</a>).
Attributes are, in effect, measures. Measures are typed in order to define
the value storage mechanism being used. Attributes have one of the following
value-types assigned:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>real:</i></strong> A real number or a real interval.</li>
<li><strong><i>integer:</i></strong> An integer or an integer interval.</li>
<li><strong><i>count:</i></strong> A cardinal number or a cardinal number interval.</li>
<li><strong><i>index: </i></strong>An integer used for identification.</li>
<li><strong><i>string:</i></strong> A character string.</li>
<li><strong><i>constrained string:</i></strong> A <i>string</i> whose format and
 values are constrained in the definition of the EA.</li>
<li><strong><i>key:</i></strong> A <i>string</i> used for identification.</li>
<li><strong><i>enumeration:</i></strong> One of a finite set of mutually exclusive values.</li>
<li><strong><i>boolean:</i></strong> An <i>enumeration</i>, representing the true
 and false values in a two-valued logic system, with values FALSE (0) and
 TRUE (1).</li>
<li><strong><i>null:</i></strong> An <i>enumeration</i> with one value, NULL (0),
 representing no information.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Real-</i>, <i>integer-</i>, and <i>count-</i>typed attributes may
be either a single value or an interval (value-pair). Real-typed
attributes have units of measure, which are captured in the
<a href="dictionary/units.htm">EU Dictionary</a>.
</p><p>
Measures may be missing, withheld, many-valued (for a partitioned
range), <i>etc</i>. These value characteristcs are captured using
concepts in the <a href="dictionary/characteristic.htm">EV Dictionary</a>.
<hr width="100%">
<a name="5" id="5"><strong>ATTRIBUTE ENUMERANTS</strong></a>
<p>
While some measures are continuously valued (<i>real</i>,
<i>integer</i>, <i>count</i>), others are discretely valued (e.g.,
<i>null</i>, <i>boolean</i>, <i>enumeration</i>). While the discrete
values of <i>null</i> and <i>boolean</i> can be pre-defined, the discrete
values of <i>enumeration</i> depend on the attribute concept -- hence
attributes of value-type <i>enumeration</i> must declare their value
domain (e.g., attribute <i>colour</i> has the value domain of {<i>red</i>,
<i>orange</i>, <i>yellow</i>, <i>green</i>, ...} ). Concepts in the value
domain of a measure (attribute) have their own
<a href="dictionary/EAC.htm">EE Dictionary</a>,
and all of the mechanisms applied to classifications (which are
typings-of-objects, as opposed to typings-of-discrete-values-of-measures)
are applied to attribute enumerants.
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<a name="6" id="6"><strong>UNITS OF MEASURE and VALUE CONVERSION</strong></a>
<p>
Units characterize the measurement of quantities. Some quantities may
have more than one appropriate unit-of-measure. Unit equivalence classes
(in the <a href="dictionary/units.htm">EQ Dictionary</a>)
identify units that are comparable, and
therefore values characterized by those different units of measure can be
interconverted (<i>e.g.</i>, foot-to / from-metre). A functional interface
is defined, and implemented, to support such value conversions. While most
units are compliant with the SI (Syst&egrave;me International), some
predate the SI. While they are supported, they are also deprecated
(<i>e.g.</i>, statute mile, hectare, knot, rad).
Attribute values may be scaled in order
to better support a community of interest (<i>e.g.</i>, kilometres,
hectopascal, milligrams). The
<a href="dictionary/units.htm">ES Dictionary</a> includes such concepts.
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<a name="7" id="7"><strong>ORGANIZING CONCEPTS</strong></a>
<p>
Concepts can be organized into groups (in the
<a href="dictionary/groups.htm">EG Dictionary</a>)
sharing a common &quot;scope of application&quot; or &quot;theme&quot;
(<i>e.g.</i>, living organisms, vehicles, space, land transportation).
Concepts can be relevant
to multiple groups (<i>e.g.</i>, the U.S. Space Shuttle is relevant to
both the vehicles and space groups). Classifications and attributes can be
(multiply) grouped. Groups aid in searching the EDCS to find concepts of
relevance to a coding task. Membership in a group does <i>not</i>
affect/change the concept.
</p><p>
Groups are members of organizational schema (in the
<a href="dictionary/groups.htm">EO Dictionary</a>),
such that every classification or attribute concept is
required to be a member of at least one group in that schema. This ensures
that there are no &quot;holes&quot; in the coverage of the groups comprising a
schema. Many schema (and their groups) can be defined; each from the
perspective of a community-of-interest. Only one such schema is currently
defined, <i>general</i>, however more can be easily added.
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<a name="8" id="8"><strong>REGISTRATION and DEPRECATION</strong></a>
<p>
In order to support continuous evolution and growth of the EDCS, a
low-overhead process of <i>registration</i> has been defined, allowing for
the timely addition of new concepts to the EDCS. Additionally, a slower,
measured process of <i>deprecation</i> has been defined for removing
out-dated or inappropriate concepts from the EDCS.
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<a name="9" id="9"><strong>PROFILES</strong></a>
<p>
In order to support the specification of rational <i>subsets</i> of
the EDCS for use within a community, and <i>constraints</i> on the use of
specific combinations of concepts from the EDCS, a profile mechanism has
been defined. The <I>base profile</I> includes all concepts from all EDCS
Dictionaries, and includes no constraints. Additional profiles may be
defined through the registration process.
