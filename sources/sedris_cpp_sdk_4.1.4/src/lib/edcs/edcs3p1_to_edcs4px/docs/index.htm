<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>
Thank you for downloading this release of the
EDCS 3.1 to EDCS 4.x Mapping Software Development Kit (SDK).
This SDK is intended as a &quot;drop-in&quot; into the EDCS SDK.
</p><p>
This release has been tested on multiple platforms, such as Linux, Irix, Sun,
and Windows 98/Me/NT/2000.
</p><p>
For help, comments, and bug reports please send email to
<a href="mailto:help@sedris.org">help@sedris.org</a>. If you are an associate, please use

<h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>
This SDK is meant to be installed into an EDCS SDK installation. The files in this
SDK should be extracted inside the EDCS SDK top level directory. If you have a
previous installation of this SDK and you don't want to overwrite it, you should
rename the &quot;edcs3p1_to_edcs4px&quot; directory to some other name.
</p><p>
This SDK is distributed as a GNU-zipped tar file for Unix systems and a Zip
file in Win32 systems. In the discussions that follow, the &quot;[root]&quot; directory is
the top directory of an SDK installation.
</p><p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b>Extract the contents of the compressed
file into the &quot;[root]&quot; directory of the EDCS SDK:
<ul>
<li>In Unix systems: <b>tar xvzf edcs3p1_to_edcs4px_[version].tar.gz</b>
</li>
<li>In Win32 systems: use <a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> or other
</li>
decompression utility to extract the contents of the downloaded file.
</ul>

<p>
The extraction should have created a &quot;edcs3p1_to_edcs4px&quot; subdirectory in the
&quot;[root]&quot; directory of the EDCS SDK if it didn't exist.

<h3><a name="libs">Compiling, Linking, and Testing</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>
This section describes the steps needed to compile, link, and test the software
included in this SDK. Applications and/or libraries that use this SDK
will need to refer to the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/include&quot; directory for compilation, and the
libraries in the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/lib&quot; subdirectories for linking, since those are the
places where all headers and libraries from this SDK are placed. The applications in
this SDK are similarly placed in the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/bin&quot; subdirectories.
</p><p>
To compile this SDK, follow these steps:
<dl>
<dt><b>Unix</b>
<dd>
<p>After installing this SDK as detailed in <a href="#install">Installation</a>,
a &quot;make&quot; command in the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]&quot; directory will recursively go through the
SDK directory structure and build all libraries and applications provided with the distribution
using the default settings. For this release, the default settings are:
<ul>
<li>BUILD_MODE = OPT
</li>
<li>BIND_STATIC = no
</li>
<li>USE_GNU = false (set to true under Linux)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These settings will compile the release using optimization and dynamic linking.
</p><p>
<dt><b>Win32</b>
<dd>
<p>Follow these steps to build all the SDK libraries and applications:
<ol>
<li>Prior to building this SDK you must build the EDCS SDK.</li>
<li>From Windows Explorer, locate and open (i.e. double click) the &quot;win32_headers.bat&quot; file
in the &quot;[root]&quot; directory of this SDK installation. This step copies the header files for
this SDK into the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/include&quot; directory.
</li>
<li>Open the &quot;vcpp_static.dsw&quot; Visual C++ (VC++) project workspace file for this SDK.
</li>
<li>From the Visual C++ IDE, select &quot;all_sdk&quot; as your &quot;Active Project&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; or &quot;Debug&quot;
for your &quot;Active Configuration&quot;. For example, to compile in &quot;Release&quot; mode, choose
&quot;Build->Set Active Configuration...&quot; and select the &quot;all_sdk - Win32 Release&quot; entry.
</li>
<li>From the &quot;Build&quot; menu, choose &quot;Rebuild All&quot;.
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>You can build individual applications by making them the current &quot;Active
    Project&quot; (&quot;Project->Set Active Project&quot; menu), and choosing &quot;Rebuild All&quot;.
<li>The &quot;Release&quot; option is similar to the Unix Build Environment &quot;OPT&quot; option for
the &quot;BUILD_MODE&quot; variable.
</ul>
</dl>

<p>
To run the applications included in this SDK, see
<a href="edcs3p1_edcs4px.htm#Use Examples">Use Examples</a> to learn
about the applications, and follow the same steps as described
in the EDCS SDK documentation section
<a href="../../docs/buildkit.htm#testing">Testing the Build</a> for setting your
environment variables.
</p><p>
To build your own applications using this SDK, see the provided applications for
examples on how to create appropriate Makefiles for Unix or VC++ Project files for Win32.
