<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for downloading this release of the FACC 2.1 to EDCS 4.4 Mapping Software Development Kit (SDK).
This SDK is intended as a &quot;drop-in&quot; into the EDCS SDK.

<p>
This release has been tested on multiple platforms,
such as Linux, Irix, Sun, and Windows 98/Me/NT/2000.
</p><p>

<h3><a name="fixes">Bug Fixes</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
General:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>For the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE, updated the project files for
    the sample applications to address a dynamic linking issue.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
FACC 2.1 feature mappings:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>None.
</li>
</ol>

FACC 2.1 attribute mappings:
<ol type="a">
<li>Code was erroneously indicating that CHANGE_IN_DATATYPE mappings were
ONE_TO_ONE.
</li>
<li>ENUM to Boolean mappings are now CHANGE_IN_DATATYPE.
</li>
<li>Cases where an attribute has different targets for different
cases are now SPECIAL_CASE where they were previously ONE_TO_ONE
(affects FCO).
</li>
</ol>

FACC 2.1 &quot;code list&quot; mappings:
<ol type="a">
<li>
NST and NS2 no longer replicate the qualifier supplied by the attribute
mapping for each of the attribute value mappings.
</li>

<li>
Added notes information on a number of mappings.
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
This SDK is meant to be installed into an EDCS SDK installation.
The files in this SDK should be extracted inside the
EDCS SDK top level directory. If you have a previous installation
of this SDK and you don't want to overwrite it, you should
rename the &quot;facc2p1_to_edcs4px&quot; directory to some other name.
</p><p>
This SDK is distributed as a GNU-zipped tar file for Unix systems and a Zip
file in Win32 systems. In the discussions that follow, the &quot;[root]&quot; directory is
the top directory of an SDK installation.
</p><p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>Extract the contents of the compressed
file into the &quot;[root]&quot; directory of the EDCS SDK:
<ul>
<li>In Unix systems: <strong>tar xvzf facc2p1_to_edcs4px_[version].tar.gz</strong>
</li>
<li>In Win32 systems: use <a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> or other
</li>
decompression utility to extract the contents of the downloaded file.
</ul>

<p>
The extraction should have created a &quot;facc2p1_to_edcs4px&quot; subdirectory in the
&quot;[root]&quot; directory of the EDCS SDK if it didn't exist.

<h3><a name="libs">Compiling, Linking, and Testing</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>
This section describes the steps needed to compile, link, and test the software
included in this SDK. Applications and/or libraries that use this SDK will need
to refer to the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/include&quot; directory for compilation,
and the libraries in the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/lib&quot; subdirectories for
linking, since those are the places where all headers and libraries from this
SDK are placed. The applications in this SDK are similarly placed in the
EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/bin&quot; subdirectories.
</p><p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
The libraries produced by this SDK depend on the EDCS Mapping Utilities
library having been compiled and installed before you compile this SDK.
</p><p>
To compile this SDK, follow these steps:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Unix</strong>
<dd>
<p>
After installing this SDK as detailed in
<a href="#install">Installation</a>,
a &quot;make&quot; command in the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]&quot; directory will
recursively go through the SDK directory structure and
build all libraries and applications provided with the distribution
using the default settings. For this release, the default settings are:
<ul>
<li>BUILD_MODE = OPT
</li>
<li>BIND_STATIC = no
</li>
<li>USE_GNU = false (set to true under Linux)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These settings will compile the release using optimization and dynamic linking.

<p>
<dt><strong>Win32</strong>
<dd>
<p>
Follow these steps to build all the SDK libraries and applications:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Prior to building this SDK you must build the EDCS SDK and the
EDCS Mapping Utilities SDK.
</p></li>

<li><p>
If the EDCS Mapping Utilities SDK has not yet been installed, then
from Windows Explorer, locate and open (<I>i.e.</I>, double click)
the &quot;win32_headers.bat&quot; file in the &quot;[root]&quot; directory
of the EDCS Mapping Utilities SDK installation. This step copies the header
files of that SDK into the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/include&quot; directory.
</p></li>

<li><p>
From Windows Explorer, locate and open (<I>i.e.</I>, double click)
the &quot;win32_headers.bat&quot; file in the &quot;[root]&quot; directory
of this SDK installation. This step copies the header files for
this SDK into the EDCS SDK &quot;[root]/include&quot; directory.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Open the &quot;vcpp_static.dsw&quot; Visual C++ (VC++) project workspace file
for this SDK.
</p></li>

<li><p>
From the Visual C++ IDE, select &quot;all_sdk&quot; as your
&quot;Active Project&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; or
&quot;Debug&quot; for your &quot;Active Configuration&quot;. For example,
to compile in &quot;Release&quot; mode, choose &quot;Build->Set Active Configuration...&quot;
and select the &quot;all_sdk - Win32 Release&quot; entry.
</p></li>

<li><p>
From the &quot;Build&quot; menu, choose &quot;Rebuild All&quot;.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
You can build individual applications by making them the current &quot;Active
Project&quot; (&quot;Project->Set Active Project&quot; menu), and choosing &quot;Rebuild All&quot;.
</li>

<li>
The &quot;Release&quot; option is similar to the Unix Build Environment &quot;OPT&quot; option for
the &quot;BUILD_MODE&quot; variable.
</li>
</ul>
</dl>

<p>
To run the applications included in this SDK, see
<a href="facc2p1_edcs4px.htm#Use Examples">Use Examples</a> to learn
about the applications, and follow the same steps as described
in the EDCS SDK documentation section
<a href="../../docs/buildkit.htm#testing">Testing the Build</a> for setting
your environment variables.
</p><p>
To build your own applications using this SDK, see the provided applications
for examples on how to create appropriate Makefiles for Unix or
VC++ Project files for Win32.
